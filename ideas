Computer Vision
- detect Hand -> Finger pinch
   - follow index finger when pinched
   - controller off when hand open
- draw shadow of hand in background of window?



General
- counting rotations of robot and reference (potentially different when controller off)
   - angle = angle * (rotation reference - rotation arm) [?]

Angle problem
- INSTEAD of adjusting dersired angle
   - reset angle every time it hits 2pi!!!

Structure
- seperate class for all bools etc (maybe in event_checks.h)
  - toggle them there and reach them around
